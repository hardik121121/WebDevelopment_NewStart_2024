     <p>To remove conflict issues Css uses "The Cascade Algorithm"; This Algorithm determines that which property will be applied in css and which property won't.</p>
     <br>
     <p>Since there are multiple color properties applied in the same element so which property will be winning? </p>
     <ol><h4>There are 4 rules according to the cascade algorithm :</h4>
       <li>Position and order of appearance: the order in which your css rules operator.</li>
       <li>Specificity: an algorithm that determines which css selector has the strongest match.</li>
       <li>Origin: the orderin which css appears and where it comes from, wether that is a  browser style, css from a browser extension, on your authored css</li>
      <li>Importance: Some css rules are weighted more heavily than others, especially with the important rule type.</li></ol>
